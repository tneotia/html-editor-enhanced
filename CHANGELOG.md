   * Refactored `height`, `autoAdjustHeight`, `decoration`, `showBottomToolbar`, and `darkMode` into new `HtmlEditorOptions` class - see README for how to migrate
   * Removed 'Summernote Classes' plugin
   * Sorry for all the breaking changes lately - I think I've finally figured out how I want to do the API design so there should be far less in future releases

* Added `onImageLinkInsert` callback that fires when an image is inserted via URL
* Added `shouldEnsureVisible` that scrolls the editor into view when it is focused or text is typed, kind of like `TextField`s

* Added a few new parameters:
   * `autoAdjustHeight` - for `HtmlEditor`: default true, automatically adjusts the height of the editor to make sure scrolling is not necessary
   * `processInputHtml` - for `HtmlEditorController`: processes input HTML (e.g. new lines become `<br/>`)

## [1.4.0] - 2021-03-01
* [BREAKING] removed `HtmlParser` for calling methods, instead you now must pass an `HtmlEditorController` to the plugin (like a `TextField`). All methods are accessible from that controller. See the usage section in the README for an example.
   * This allows you to have multiple independent editors on a page, whereas earlier the package would not know which editor the method should be called on.
* Add support for certain Summernote plugins from [Summernote Awesome](https://github.com/summernote/awesome-summernote). See the README for details on the API and the currently supported plugins.
* Nullsafety pre-release coming soon.

   * onPaste
